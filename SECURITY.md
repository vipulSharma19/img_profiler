3. **Provide Details:** Include thorough information about the vulnerability, steps to reproduce it, and any potential impact.

We will acknowledge your email within 48 hours and strive to provide regular updates as we address the issue.

## Responsible Disclosure

We kindly ask that you refrain from publicly disclosing the vulnerability until we have had sufficient time to investigate and address it. We appreciate your cooperation in keeping our users and systems safe.
